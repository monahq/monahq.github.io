It is our goal to provide you with information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, respect your privacy. </p> <p> Please read this Policy carefully. Your access to or use of any part of the Services will constitute your notice about our collection, use, and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Policy. If you do not wish for us to collect, use, and disclose your information in accordance with this Policy, please do not access or use the Services. </p> <p> This Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Services and does not apply to any third-party activities, including third-party websites linked from our Services, third-party social networking platforms or features we make available through our Services, or third-party ads displayed on our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of those third parties. </p> <p> We consider personal information to be information that can be traced directly back to and identifies a specific individual or household, such as name, address, email address, and/or phone number. We do not consider personal information to include information that alone does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual or household. </p> <p> We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Services. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to us or the Services. </p> <ol> <li> <strong>Highlights of what you are consenting to</strong> <p> By using the Services, you are consenting to: <ul> <li>the collection, use, and processing of information collected from the online accounts you connect to the Service, such as email receipts;</li> <li>the use of Cookies and Related Technologies;</li> <li>the sharing of anonymous transaction information with third parties;</li> <li>the sharing of personal information, including transaction information, with service providers and vendors;</li> <li>the collection, use, sharing and other processing of your information as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</li> </ul> </p> <p> This policy applies to information we collect: <ul> <li>On this website;</li> <li>In email, text or other electronic messages between you and this website;</li> <li>Through mobile and desktop applications you download from this Website or from an application merchant, which provide dedicated non-browser-based interaction between you and this Website.</li> <li>When you interact with our advertising and applications on third-party websites and services, if those applications or advertising include links to this policy.</li> </ul> </p> <p> It does not apply to information collected by: <ul> <li>us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by Company or any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries); or</li> <li>any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries), including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Website.</li> </ul> </p> </li> <li> <strong>The Information We Collect</strong> <p> <strong>Registration and Customer Support.</strong> We collect personal information when you register, such as your name and email address. We may also collect personal information from you in other ways, such as through with our customer support team. </p> <p> <strong>Email and Other Accounts.</strong> You may also provide information necessary to use the Services, such as the login credentials for your email, social networking, or other Internet accounts that you link to the Services. By linking the Services to your email or other Internet accounts, you authorize us to gather, parse, and retain information, including personal information, from past and future emails and other communications you receive that relate to your online and offline shopping and purchasing ("transaction information"). You may associate your email accounts with the Service by providing us with log-in credentials for your email accounts. Once you have authorized us to do so by associating your accounts, we will use our automated technology to regularly review the contents of emails in your email accounts to look for shopping related emails, including those with information about recent purchases or shopping newsletters. </p> <p> <strong>Social Media Log-In.</strong> We receive and retain basic information about you when you use a social media website (such as Facebook) to log into the Services. This information generally includes your name, email, website ID and public profile with the service. We may receive and retain demographic information about you through a social sign-on. </p> <p> <strong>From Others.</strong> We may collect information from vendors and suppliers and combine it with information that we have about you. </p> <p> <strong>Cookies and Related Technologies.</strong> We use "cookies" and similar technologies to collect and store information that is generated automatically as you use the Services, including your preferences and usage statistics. Most browsers allow you to manage cookies including blocking and deleting them. If you block or delete our cookies, the Services may not work as well or at all for you. We also record information on our server logs that is collected from your browser or app, including your IP address, Mona cookie information, device identifier, browser type, device type, domain name, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new and repeat information, timestamp, exit page information, and other information about how you use the Service. </p> <p> <strong>Mobile Device Information.</strong> We use tools, including third party analytical software, to automatically collect certain anonymous data about your device that does not directly identify you, such as: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to unique or other device identifier; (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as country or region; (v) other similar data as reasonably required by us to enhance the Services and other Mona products and services. We may use this information as described in this Policy, including, for example, to provide you with offers or opportunities based upon your location and shopping goals. </p> <p> <strong>Usage Information.</strong> When you use our Services, we will automatically collect information about how you use our Services. </p> <p> <strong>Other Information We Collect.</strong> In some circumstances, such as making a purchase of our products, we will request that you provide your credit card, debit card, or acceptable payment option and your billing address and shipping address. You are welcome to not provide this information, but if you do not wish to provide this information then there is no way for us to ship you our products. When you place an order, Mona will collect and store your shipping address and billing address. Your payment information, such as credit card information, will be maintained by the third-party payment processor, and not Mona. In order to facilitate your order, Mona must share your order information with each third-party brand you order from using the Services. In some instances a third-party brand may request your email or mobile phone number to help facilitate your purchase. When requested, we will provide your email or mobile phone number to the third-party manufacturer or retailer you have placed an order with. We encourage you to review each third-party manufacturer’s or retailer’s terms and conditions and privacy policy to understand what each third-party brand does with this information once transmitted by Mona. </p> </li> <li> <strong>How We Use Your Information</strong> <p> We use the information we collect, including your personal information and transaction information for internal and service-related purposes, such as to provide, improve, and personalize our Services, and to develop new ones. We also use the information to communicate with you in order to provide you with information we think may be useful or relevant to you; to promote the Services; to analyze information in order to offer anonymized data products to third parties; to facilitate the sharing of anonymized information, including transaction data, as set forth below; to enforce this Privacy Policy, the <a href="terms">Terms of Use</a>, and to protect the rights, property, or safety of Mona or its users; and as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy. We may also use your personal information to respond to your comments and questions and provide customer service; to send you information related to your requests and purchases; link or combine your personal information with other information we get about your use of other Services and from third parties to help understand you and your needs, and provide you with recommendations, better service, and customized marketing; and protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity. </p> </li> <li> <strong>How We Share Your Information</strong> <p> Other third parties may collect information about you through our Services, including personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our Services. We describe some of those activities below, but understand that our Policy does not cover these or any other third parties, their products, actions, or their services. We cannot control how third parties collect, use, or secure your data. For information about third-party privacy practices, please consult their privacy policies. </p> <p> <strong>Affiliated businesses and third-party websites we do not control.</strong> In certain situations, businesses or third-party websites we're affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your personal information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. </p> <p> <strong>Service Providers.</strong> You can log in to our Services using sign-in services provided by third parties, including certain third-party social networking platforms. Certain third-party services we may feature through our Services give you social media options to interact with buttons or widgets that let you like information or post information about your activities from our Site to third party sites and platforms publicly or within your network. These services will share certain personal information with us as described in the sign-in notices or in their privacy policies. </p> <p> <strong>Vendors and Suppliers.</strong> We may disclose your information, including personal information and transaction information, to service providers for the purposes of managing, providing, and improving the Services, analyzing usage of the Services, and for marketing purposes. </p> <p> <strong>Public Profile.</strong> You may choose to display certain information you give us in your public profile. Our Site also offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you choose to share in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others. To request removal of your content or information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@monahq.com">hello@monahq.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. </p> <p> <strong>Promotional offers.</strong> We may send offers to certain users on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address. If you do not wish to receive these offers, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:hello@monahq.com">hello@monahq.com</a>. </p> <p> <strong>With your consent.</strong> </p> <p> <strong>Other.</strong> We may access, preserve, and disclose collected information, if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; respond to your requests; or protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety. If all or a portion of Mona or its assets are sold or transferred, personal information and other information we have collected may be treated as an asset and transferred in accordance with this Policy. </p> </li> <li> <strong>How Your Information Is Protected</strong> <p> We maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to promote the integrity and confidentiality of the personally identifiable information. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p> </li> <li> <strong>What Choices Are Available to You on Our Services</strong> <p> We think that you benefit from a more personalized experience when we know more about you and your Mona experiences. However, in some cases you can limit the information you provide to us, and you can limit the communications that we send to you. </p> <p> In the Settings section, you may edit your interests and other shopping-related preferences (e.g. your brand preferences), link or unlink an external account including emails and social networks. You may choose to deactivate your Mona account through your account settings. If you do, we will disassociate your personal information from your purchase data. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your personal information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. </p> <p> If you wish to cancel your account, modify your information, or request that we no longer use your information to provide you the Service, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@monahq.com">hello@monahq.com</a>. </p> </li> <li> <strong>International Visitors</strong> <p> Mona is hosted in and intended for use in the United States by U.S. residents. We may transfer your personal information within Mona and in accordance with this policy. We may also subcontract processing to, or share your information with, third parties located in countries other than your home country. </p> <p> By using the Services, you will transfer data to the United States. If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal information to the United States to Mona. By providing your personal information you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Policy. </p> </li> <li> <strong>How To Contact Us</strong> <p> If you have questions or suggestions, please email us at <a href="mailto:hello@monahq.com">hello@monahq.com</a>. Written communication should be sent to Mona Labs Inc., Attn: Customer Service, 2211 Elliott Avenue, Suite 200 Seattle, WA, 98121. </p> </li> <li> <strong>Updates to This Policy</strong> <p> We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy and change the "last revised" date above. If we make any material changes, notice of the changes will be posted along with the revised Privacy Policy. </p> </li> </ol> <br/> <br/> <br/> </div> </div> <div class="monaBlock" id="footerBlock"> <div class="monaBlock wrapper" id="footerBlock"> <div class="monaInnerBlock" id="footerBlockInner"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-3 col-xs-12 text-center"> <a href=""><img id="v2logoFooter" src="/assets/images/logo-footer@3x.png"/></a> </div> <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-0 v2navbarLink text-center col-xs-offset-0 col-xs-12" style="padding-top:25px; padding-bottom: 20px;"> <a class="footerLinkV2" href="about">ABOUT US</a> <br class="desktopHidden mobileShown"/> <a class="footerLinkV2" href="//medium.com/@ShopWithMona" target="_blank">BLOG</a> <a class="footerLinkV2" href="mailto:hello@monahq.com">CONTACT US</a> </div> <div class="col-sm-3 col-sm-offset-0 text-center v2navbarLink col-xs-12" style="color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);"> CONNECT WITH US ON <br/> <a target="_blank" href="//twitter.com/shopwithmona"><i class="fa fa-twitter socialLinkV2"></i></a> <a target="_blank" href="//www.instagram.com/shopwithmona/"><i class="fa fa-instagram socialLinkV2"></i></a> <a target="_blank" href="//www.facebook.com/JoinMona"><i class="fa fa-facebook socialLinkV2"></i></a> <a target="_blank" href="//www.linkedin.com/company/10015748"><i class="fa fa-linkedin socialLinkV2"></i></a> <a target="_blank" href="mailto:hello@monahq.com"><i class="fa fa-envelope socialLinkV2"></i></a> </div> </div> <div class="row belowFooterLink" style="padding-top:25px;"> <div class="text-center col-xs-12 col-xs-offset-0"> <a class="belowFooterLinkV2" href="privacy">Privacy Policy</a> <a class="belowFooterLinkV2" href="terms">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> <br class="desktopHidden mobileShown"/> <span class="belowFooterLinkV2">Copyright &copy; 2017 Mona Labs Inc.
