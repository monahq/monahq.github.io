You may terminate your use of the Services at any time. Company may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or your membership at any time, for any reason, and without warning, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your membership.

Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Services, access the Website, and any Content will immediately cease.

You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Mona must be resolved by a court located in King County, Washington, except as otherwise agreed by the parties or as described in the Arbitration Option paragraph below. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within King County, Washington for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. </p> </li> <li> <strong>Arbitration</strong> <p> Any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) shall be resolved exclusively by binding non-appearance-based arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules ("AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), but the parties do not necessarily intend for the AAA to administer the arbitration. The arbitration will take place in Seattle, Washington and the internal laws of the State of Washington (other than conflicts of laws rules) and of the United States of America shall apply. Part or all of the arbitration may be conducted by telephone or based on written submissions, and will not require the personal appearance of the parties or any witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The allocation of costs and fees for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules. If such costs are finally determined to be excessive in a consumer dispute, Mona will be responsible for paying all arbitration fees and arbitrator compensation in excess of what is deemed reasonable. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator engaged in the practice of law who is mutually agreed upon by the parties or failing such agreement within 14 days from the delivery of the original arbitration demand, each party shall select one arbitrator and the two selected arbitrators shall mutually agree upon the selection of a third arbitrator within 30 days from the delivery of the original arbitration demand. The arbitrator's decision and award shall be final and binding and may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent a party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief with respect to the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of such party’s intellectual property or other proprietary rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event the foregoing agreement to arbitrate is deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable with respect to any claim, dispute or controversy, then you agree that any such claim, dispute or controversy shall be filed and adjudicated only in the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington and Registrant hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement. </p> </li> <li> <strong>Limitation of Liability and Indemnification</strong> <p> You expressly understand and agree that Mona and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners, and licensors shall not be liable to you for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if Mona has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use Mona; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through, from or as a result of Mona; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on Mona; or (v) any other matter relating to Mona. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations in this paragraph may not apply to you. </p> <p> We are not liable for anything that happens to you that somehow may be connected to your use of the Site. If you use the Site in a way that causes us to be included in litigation, you agree to pay all legal fees and costs we incur. </p> <p> You further agree and understand that Mona has no liability for the loss of any information you may chose to store in your Mona account in your computer or mobile device, in the event your computer or mobile device is sold, lost or stolen. </p> <p> You agree to indemnify and hold Mona and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, partners, and licensors harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of Mona. </p> </li> <li> <strong>Fees and Payment</strong> <p> Although our Services are currently free to users, Company reserves the right to require payment of fees for certain or all Services. You shall pay all applicable fees, as described on the Website in connection with such Services selected by you. Company reserves the right to change its price list and to institute new charges at any time, upon notice to you, which may be sent by email or posted on the Website. Your use of the Services following such notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges. Any fees paid hereunder are non-refundable. </p> </li> <li> <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> <p> The failure of either party to exercise, in any respect, any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Company shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Company's reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including "line-noise" interference). If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Company's prior written consent. Company may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without consent. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Company in any respect whatsoever.
